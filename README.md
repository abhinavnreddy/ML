  I refered so many articles online and didn't know where to start, but in the end i found some good articles and started my ML journey.
<a href="https://medium.com/vickdata/programming-skills-a-complete-roadmap-for-learning-data-science-part-1-7913b289751b">Here </a>is a Roadmap for Learning Data Science By -REBECCA and <a href="https://monkeylearn.com/blog/getting-started-with-python-machine-learning/">here</a> is another article by MonkeyLearn for getting started with ML. I chose python for learning ML.
<br>
  I thought of starting with NumPy library because its the base for all other liraries like Keras, TensorFlow, etc., which has the methods to create and manipulate arrays. This is used to do arithmetis operations on an array of numbers with ease. <a href="https://stackabuse.com/numpy-tutorial-a-simple-example-based-guide/">This</a> article gives an idea on NumPy library. Then I refered tutorials of <a href="">Matplotlib</a> and <a href="">Pandas</a> from their official websites.
  <br>I also started a ML course on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Coursera</a> By Andrew Ng, which is recommended by many people. My first assignment was solving a Univariate Linear Regression problem, which I had to submit using Octave. Later I wrote the code from scratch in Python.
